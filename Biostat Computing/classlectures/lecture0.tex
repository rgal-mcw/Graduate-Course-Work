\begin{itemize}
\item for computer science and technology, it is an excellent free
  choice when others are unavailable
\item most articles have citations for those who need to dig further
\item it is very helpful as an introduction to a new topic
\item but doesn't have much to offer for those learning R and SAS
\item the follow-on to Nupedia which I was a part of in 2000
\item Nupedia founded by Jimmy Wales %with an estimated net worth
%  today of \$1M (via google search) \\
who later founded Wikipedia in January 2001 which arose from it
% \item I worked with Larry Sanger Editor-in-chief of Nupedia\\
%  (later Editor-in-chief of Wikipedia) with an estimated net worth of
%   \$650K (a google search did not reveal my net worth!)
\item Nupedia was a dramatic failure and a footnote in history
\item But it spawned Wikipedia a major unintended success
\item wiki is simple hence its popularity: ironically I far prefer LaTeX

\frametitle{RTFM: Read the F****ing Manual}

``If all else fails read the instructions.''
 Donald Knuth, a renowned computer scientist and 
the inventor of TeX (precursor to LaTeX) and many 
other achievements, might (or might not) have said this

\begin{itemize}
\item Unix means UNIX, Linux, macOS or similar Unix-like operating systems
\item To identify Unix-like: {\tt .Platform\$OS.type=="unix"}
\item A counter-example: it does NOT mean Microsoft Windows
\item To identify MS Windows: {\tt .Platform\$OS.type=="windows"}
\item  \red{on gouda} {\tt \$ man} Unix-command like {\tt \$ man man}
\item  \red{on gouda} {\tt \$ info} Unix-command like {\tt \$ info info}
\item Emacs has the capability to render both types as we'll see
\item {\tt M-x man}
\item {\tt M-x info}
\item N.B.\ the Helvetica sans serif proportional font used for text
  whereas a fixed-width {\tt teletype/typewriter} font with
  serifs is used for commands and URLs, etc., i.e., what you type
\end{itemize}

\begin{comment}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Recurring themes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Linux/UNIX/Unix-like support multi-threading/processing
\item Windows is unable to ``fork'': R multi-threading is crippled
\item Spreadsheets are not type safe: {\tt wikipedia Type\_safety}
\item SAS excels at sorting and merging data especially with unique
  keys providing user-friendly errors/warnings/notes
\item R can sort/merge but is often silent about mis-specification
\item R has a rich interactive environment and SAS does NOT
\item R and C++ are object-oriented and Rcpp glues them together
\item Emacs is a programmer's editor and we are programmers
\item Emacs supports many languages like C/C++ and LaTeX
\item ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistics) supports R and SAS
\item RStudio is a waste of time
\item x2go ``accelerates'' X11 traffic over the Internet 
\item Reproducible errors vs.\ sporadic errors

\frametitle{Typical biostatistical computing stack}
(TIOBE Index of the Top 100 Programming Languages:\\ 
August 2022)
\url{https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index}

\begin{itemize}
\item GNU/Linux kernel
\item GNU Compiler Collection (GCC): C(2)/C++(4)/Fortran(19)
\item GNU tools: bash(43), core utilities
\item GNU Emacs: programmer' editor \\
mostly written in Emacs Lisp(30) and the rest in C
\item GNU R(16): its free and is supported by other free software\\
Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): 18558 packages\\
descendent of S and S-Plus
\item SAS(24) is not free, but MCW has a site-wide license\\
(that I negotiated)
\item X Window System and GNOME2/MATE
\item Structured Query Language: SQL(9) for relational databases
\item TeX Live bundle of TeX/LaTeX 
\item Python(1)/Java(3)/Perl(20) NOT used much in biostatistics\\
so they will not be discussed further in this course\\
\red{N.B. Python is interactive (slow) so we naturally use R instead}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Data Advantages of R and/or SAS vs.\ everything else}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{programming languages for data processing and analysis} 
\item convenient environments that are naturally \textcolor{red}{vectorized}
\item many years of refinement: SAS (1966) and S/R (1976)
\item wide availability on many platforms
\item particularly well-adapted to Linux/UNIX (and macOS for R)\\
neither SAS nor R adapt well to Windows as we'll see
\item reasonably priced: R is free and SAS is paid for by employers
\item at MCW, SAS is free for students and cheap/free for others
\item large user community of statisticians and related professions
\item interfaces for data input and data management systems
\item many functions of interest such as probability distributions
\item facilitate the creation of graphical visualizations 
\item provide access to advanced statistical analysis routines:
NOT the focus of this course so listed last, but immensely important

\frametitle{Advantages of the Client-Server Model: \textcolor{blue}{the Server}}
Modern GNU/Linux Server Technology Layers
\begin{itemize}
%\item Standards: %Single UNIX Specification (SUS) and 
%	   Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)
\item Linux kernel:  always in memory facilitating hardware/software
	  % UNIX flavors: Bell Labs, Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) 
	  % and CMU Mach
	  % GNU Linux flavors: Red Hat/CentOS and Debian
\item Software tools:
%	  UNIX flavors: Bell Labs and BSD 
    	  GNU Project
\item Dynamic shared libraries and package managers:
\item %Networking: 
	  Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)\\
Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Level Security (SSL/TLS) %and Secure Shell (SSH)
%	  Virtual Private Network (VPN)
\item Programming language: 
%	  ISO/IEC C/C++ programming language
	  GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)%: C/C++/Fortran
\item Graphical User Interface:
	  X.org X Window System\\ X version 11 (X11) protocol
%	  Tcl/Tk Tool Command Language (Tcl) and Toolkit (Tk)
%	  NX technology
	  and GNOME2/MATE
\item Text: 
%     	  7-bit 
American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)
%     	  8/16/32-bit ISO/IEC 10646 
and Unicode Transformation Format (UTF)
%\item Font technology:
          % Adobe Type 1
	  % Apple TrueType
          % fontconfig
%\item Printing: Adobe PostScript (PS) and Portable Document Format (PDF)
\item File system:
     Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID), 
     Journaling,
     %Silicon Graphics/Red Hat 
Extents File System (XFS) and \textcolor{red}{tape backup}
\item Central Processing Unit (CPU):
%     Instruction Set: 
AMD64/x86-64
     Multi-threading: servers typically have 2 or 4 CPUs and each has multiple cores capable of 1 or 2 threads %(most laptops too)
\item General Purpose Computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU):
     As a consequence, incapable of audio/video 
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Advantages of the Client-Server Model: \textcolor{blue}{the Client}}
Many layers are similar: just listing important differences
\begin{itemize}
\item Use your PC/Mac as the client rather than 
                comparable server hardware/software which does not
		work as well for a variety of reasons: not up-to-date,
                lacking hardware/drivers, %Microsoft Office support, 
		etc.
\item Client software: email software with calendaring/filtering/etc., 
modern web browsers and Microsoft Office support
\item Graphics Processing Units (GPU):
          Capable of processing audio/video
\item File system: \textcolor{red}{NO TAPE BACKUP} \\ 
\textcolor{blue}{Store everything that you want
to keep on the server}
\item Virtual Private Network (VPN): with VPN software
the client can reach the server from ANYWHERE via the Internet
(ANYWHERE except MCW because the VPN hardware is on the
Internet side of our local connection so we can't get to it,
but we don't need to when we are on campus)

%\item (these might work on earlier versions of macOS: haven't tried)
\item Copy this file (newer versions of emacs also have issues): 
{\tt /data/shared/04224/emacs/emacs-26.3.tar.gz}
\item And extract: {\tt \$ tar xzf emacs-26.3.tar.gz -C /}
