##### Read the grip data. It consists of 2 treatments (trt), 2 genders (gender), and 3 measurement occasions (time=1,2,3), a baseline covariate (x), and a response variable (y).
### 1.) Fit a marginal model for repeated measures including trt, gender, time, and x. Use the unstructured covariance for errors. Treat trt, gender, and time as categorical variables. State your model and assumptions.

*SAS Code*:
```
/* I think we can use both glimmix and mix */
proc glimmix data=grip;
    class trt gender time;
    model y=trt gender time x / solution ddfm=kr;
    random _residual_ / subject=subject type=un vcorr;
run;

proc mixed data=grip;
  class trt gender time;
  model y = trt gender time x / solution;
  repeated time / type=un subject=subject;
run;
```
I used both to compare outcomes, and they give relatively the same results. Our model:
$$ y=67.7588 + -1.2531*trt_1 + -36.8416*Female + -1.0910*time_1 + 3.6568*time_2 + 0.7431*x$$
This marginal model assumts that y is continuous and normally distributed. It assumes that the residuals are IID. I believe we also need our repeated variable (time) to have $cov(time,trt) \sim cov(time,gender) \sim cov(time,x)$.

### 2.) Test whether there is an interaction between time and the other 3 predictor variables. 
SAS CODE:
```
proc mixed data=grip;
    class trt gender time;
    model y=trt|time gender|time x|time / solution;
    repeated time / type=un subject=subject;
run;
```
SAS OUTPUT:
```

We find that there is no intercation between time and any of the other 3 predictor variables (however Gender=F and time=2 is very close to significance).

### 3) Plot a boxplot of residuals for gender. What did you observe?
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/ryangallagher/Desktop/MedicalCollegeofWisconsin/BIOS_04232_MM2/SGPlot.png")
```

We find that the Female residuals are relatively normal, where the Male residuals are quite skewed (likely as a result of two large outliars)

### 4) Base on your observation in (3), what is your recommendation? Fit a marginal model based on your recommendation. State your model and assumptions.
I decided to try a log transformation on y. This produces the box plot: 
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/ryangallagher/Desktop/MedicalCollegeofWisconsin/BIOS_04232_MM2/SGPlot1.png")
```
Here is a marginal model using the SAS code:
```
data grip2;
    set grip;
    y_prime = log(y);
run;

proc mixed data=grip2;
  class trt gender time;
  model y_prime = trt gender time x / ddfm=kr solution residual outp=residuals2;
  repeated time / type=un subject=subject;
run;
```
Where we get the model:
$$log(y) = 4.34 + 0.0126*trt_1 + -.2904*Female + -0.2452*time_1 + 0.01880*time_2 + 0.005019*x$$
And it has the same assumptions as with the untranformed version of this model. 

### 5) Based on your model in (4), test whether time=1 and time=2 are equal.
SAS INPUT:
```
proc mixed data=grip2;
    class trt gender time;
    model y_prime = trt gender time x / ddfm=kr solution;
    repeated time / type=un subject=subject;
    lsmeans time / diff cl;
run;
```
SAS OUTPUT:
```
                     Differences of Least Squares Means
 
                                 Standard
  Effect  time  _time  Estimate     Error    DF  t Value  Pr > |t|   Alpha

  time    1     2      -0.04332   0.02805  64.2    -1.54    0.1274    0.05
  time    1     3      -0.02452   0.03112  61.3    -0.79    0.4339    0.05
  time    2     3       0.01880   0.02118  57.9     0.89    0.3784    0.05

                    Differences of Least Squares Means
 
                 Effect  time  _time     Lower       Upper

                 time    1     2      -0.09936     0.01272
                 time    1     3      -0.08675     0.03771
                 time    2     3      -0.02360     0.06120
```
Thus, we see that the difference between time=1 and time=2 are not significantly different since the p_val > 0.05. We can also see that their CI for difference is [-0.09936, 0.01272], which overlaps 0. This means that we cannot confidently say that the difference between time 1 and time 2 isn't 0.
